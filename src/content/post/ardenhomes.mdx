## Website built with Wordpress with theme built from scratch.

Arden, a prominent player in the construction and real estate industry, approached us with the need for a comprehensive website to effectively display their core offerings: Display Homes, Home Designs, and Houses & Lands. Our team meticulously crafted a homepage that seamlessly integrates these elements, ensuring an engaging user experience.

A standout feature of the website is the real-time Home Plan Customizer, providing users with an interactive tool to personalize home plans. This innovative feature not only enhances user engagement but also sets Arden apart in the market. Stakeholders were not just satisfied but delighted with the website's functionality and aesthetics.

The success of this project extends beyond a visually appealing website. It positions Arden as an industry leader with a cutting-edge online platform that captivates users and allows them to envision their dream homes in real-time. This achievement underscores our commitment to delivering solutions that surpass client expectations and make a lasting impact.
